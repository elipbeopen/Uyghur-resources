# Uyghur-resources

This repository contains a collection of resources for Uyghur linguistics,
mostly constructed to assist in the initial data-gathering and data-organizing
stages of a larger project, the goal of which is the construction of an
automated speech-recognition system for the Uyghur language.

* **IPATranscriber** contains a Python script which outputs broad phonemic
transcriptions (in the International Phonetic Alphabet) of Uyghur words in
Latin orthography.

* **UyghurTransliterator** contains a Python script which transliterates an
input file (in Uyghur) from one writing system to another. Nine writing
systems are currently supported.

* **WiktionaryScraper** contains a Python script which fetches English
translations of Mandarin words from [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org).
